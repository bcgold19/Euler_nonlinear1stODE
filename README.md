# Euler_nonlinear1stODE
Approximation for the system of solution :dy/dx=y^2-x^2


 1. nonlinear_generic class is a derived class of Euler class.
 2. display method will show the result for each step in this example h=0.01 
 3. Usage of method : a) instantiate and initializing nonlinear_generic object
 4. Arguments (initial x value, initial y value, step size, how many times, coefficient for y^2, coefficient for x^2 )
 5. Enjoy




Note. I will include another types of first-order nonlinear ODEs, and several plots
